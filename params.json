The goal of this project is to make running a meta-analysis as easy as possible for researchers. Currently I am working on adding more functions, effect size calculators, tutorials, and polishing extra features. \r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Authors, Contributors, Maintainers, and Sources \r\n\r\n* [Scott Baldwin, PhD - Brigham Young University](https://github.com/psychstatistics)\r\n* [Winston Chang - R Studio](https://github.com/wch)\r\n* [Atsushi Mizumoto, PhD - Kansai University](http://mizumot.com)\r\n* [Ryan Schulteis, MD - Duke University School of Medicine](http://schulteisventures.net)\r\n* [William Kyle Hamilton - University of California, Merced](http://www.kylehamilton.com)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with this app feel free to contact William Kyle Hamilton at kyle.hamilton@gmail.com or post on the [Github page](https://github.com/kylehamilton/meta)","google":"UA-47073827-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
